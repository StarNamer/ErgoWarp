##Printing Process
I'll be using Moai 3D and their standard | tough resin with heater mod
support is made using XYZ soft
cut with cura

![image of XYZ]()
support seems excessive but without it distortion may become problematic. At this print size some distortion is inevitable at outer rim, so place in center as much as possible and reduce peeling speed if necessary.
takes about 16 hours to print.

 Wash and remove support, do not peel as it will damage surface, use your flush cutters, patients pays off.
### Post Cure
 post cure in sun or ultraviolet led. white resin will yellow if too intense so again patience.

### Post process
 this SLA print requires some post process sanding on some surface else cap will clip and switches nub to seat properly.
 notorious ones being R1C3 and R1C4.
 lightly sand nubs and check to see if switches seats without excessive force.

 grind edges as you like and smoothen the palm cover and edges that I haven't bother to smoothen via coding.
 Wash and dry. Paint if you wish

## Actual Build

### PCB
Hand wiring this takes some zen like patience, especially index R0s where thumb cluster blocks the approaches and if you are using SMD MCUs.

If I've done my job correctly Gintsugi should be up and working, simplifying some process. panelized pcb acts as a bridging mounts supported by soldering. for now it's just columnar bridging, but if I can work out the inter columnar bridge one can potentially build custom scooped keyboard without the need for a 3D printer, which is the bottle neck for most builders. reminds me of GunPura days...food for thoughts.
