# Warped-keyboard
Design Log and OpenSCAD code repo for Custom Split Keyboard

Split parametrically generated keyboard. 

##Index
 * Design Goal
 * TODO
 * Design Process
  * Finger placement design
  * Thumb cluster design
  * Tracking Device design
 * Build Logs
 * How to Generate
   * _would it be kinder recode current build into Clojure based_
   
### Design Goal:
* Customizable 
* Minimize finger movement
* Built-in Palm rest
* Tracking device
  * _in progress_
* Adjustable tenting


### TODO:
* Generalize parametric function from emperical fit to design base


### Finger Placement
###### General 

### Thumb Cluster

### Tracking Device
  #### Trackpoint 
  #### Trackpoint (Switch integration)
   * feasibility study in progress with dummy model
  #### Trackball
   * less likely due to lack of space unless sacrificing thumb cluster portion
